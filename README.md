# React + Vite

In this project i have created an simple React image cropper and painter.

Techologies Used: React js for the funtionalities and Bootstarp for the designing

work-flow: upload an image using the uploader visible in the UI-> once uploaded you can see uploaded image in the uploaded image section->you will be having two options in the form of buttons , one is for cropping and the other is for painting->once yop click the crop option you will be redirected to cropping component there you can crop the image and save the same->once saved you be redirected to the home page there you can see the cropped image under cropped images section, vice versa for painting->Also you will be having an option to paint the cropped image too


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
